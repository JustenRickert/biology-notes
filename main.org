* Questions                                                        :noexport:
- *What are hormones / What are endocrine glands?*

  /Hormones/ are blood-borne units of information sent through the body. Hormones
  are secreted by glands of the /endocrine system/.

- *How do hormones travel in the body---what body system does the body use to
  transport hormones?*

  Hormones are /blood-borne/ units of information sent through the body's
  /cardiovascular system/.

- *What hormones are involved in the release and control of Testosterone. Where
  do these hormones originate? FSH and LH*

  The /testes/ produce /testosterone/. FSH and LH and secreted from the /anterior
  pituitary gland/,
 
- *What is the action of testosterone. How are testosterone levels regulated?*

  When testosterone is too low, the anterior pituitary gland secretes LH into
  the blood stream which then makes its way to the testes, where testosterone is
  then produced.

- *What do "steroid abusers" testicles get smaller?*

  Ones' testes stop producing testosterone because there is already very
  prevalent in the blood system from direct injection by needle.

- What does insulin do / What organ produces it?

- Compare and contrast Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes---Use the Mayo site to help
  learn about Diabetes.
- http://www.webmd.com/diabetes/tc/diabetes-differences-between-type-1-and-2-topic-overview
  - Hypoglycemia :: (Low blood glucose) A diabetic should eat food. Simple
       carbohydrates or sugars would be good.
  - Hyperglycemia :: A type 1 diabetic should be taking insulin. A type 2
       diabetic needs a combination of different oral and injectable
       medications.

- Why is there no "oral insulin" -- why must it be injected?

- Is there a cure for diabetes?

- What is an auto immune disease?

- Describe the experiment done on Roosters -- the first to examine the function
  of testosterone. What was the behavior of the roosters before and after the
  removal of the testicles.

*** Seven characteristics of life
    - being made of cells

      Single-cell organisms have everything they need to be self-sufficient. In
      multicellular organisms, specialization increases until some cells do only
      certain things.
     
    - responsiveness to the environment

      Living things will make changes in response to a stimulus in their
      environment. A behavior is a complex set of responses.

    - growth and change

      Cell division -- the orderly formation of new cells. cell enlargement --
      the increase in size of a cell. An organisms gets larger as the number of
      its cells increases.

    - ability to reproduce

      Reproduction is not essential for survival of individual organisms, but
      must occur for species to survive.

    - have the metabolism and breathe / have energy

      Living things take in energy and use it for maintenance and growth.

    - maintain homeostasis

      There is an organization to all the parts of life that means they all
      depend on each other, and they must all be in equilibrium.

    - passing traits onto offspring

      Adaptions are traits giving an organism an advantage in a certain
      environment.

**** Macromolecules

     Four major molecules essential for all known forms of life are 

     - RNA
     - DNA
     - Proteins
     - Carbohydrates
   
**** Enzyme

     Macromolecule biological catalyst. /Enzymes/ accelerate, or catalyze,
     chemical reactions. Lower /activation energy/ to increase rate of a
     reaction. 

     Usually /proteins/. A lot of the time used to break down more complex
     chemicals and compounds.
    
*** Scientific Method
    - Ask a Question
    - Construct a Hypothesis
    - Test with experiment
    - Analyze data and draw conclusions
    - Communicate results

** Ch. 2
   Scale for acidity or basicity of an aqueous solution. Measure of the hydrogen
   ion density in the the solution.

   - Carbon is the basis of organic molecules.

   - Lipids are not soluble in water.

   - ATP :: /Adenosine triphosphate/ A small molecule used in cells as a
        coenzyme.

        The molecular unit of currency of intracellular energy transfer.

** Ch. 3
   - Cholesterol :: An organic molecule; a sterol (or modified steroid), a lipid
        molecule and is biosynthesized by all animal cells. An essential
        structural component of all animal cell membranes that is required to
        maintain both membrane structural integrity and fluidity.

     - Latin /chole-/ bile /stereos/ solid

   - Fluid mosaic :: The plasma membrane can be described as fluid combination
        of phospholipids, cholesterol, and proteins. Fluid on inside and outside
        of the membrane.

   - Diffusion :: Movement of molecules or atoms from a region of high
        concentration to a region of low concentration.

   - Osmosis :: Movement of solvent molecules *through a semi-permeable
        membrane* into a region of higher solute concentration.

*** Diffusion vs. Active Transport

    | Diffusion (Passive Transport) | Active Transport |
    |-------------------------------+------------------|
    | quick                         | slow             |
    | down a gradient               | up a gradient    |
    | no energy                     | need energy      |
    | no protein                    | need protein     |

    - Endocytosis :: Form of active transport in which a cell transports
         molecules by engulfing them in an energy-using process.

    - Exocytosis :: Form of active transport in which cell transports molecules
         out of the cell.

** Ch. 5
   The /skeletal system/ is composed of bones, ligaments, and cartilage; it is an
   /organ system/. It _supports_ and _protects_ the other organ systems of the
   body and provides a structure that enables _movement_.

   Bones are living cells surrounded by extracellular deposits of calcium
   minerals. 
    - Support
    - Movement
    - Protection
    - Formation of blood cells
    - Mineral and fat storage
      - like phosphorous, calcium

*** four types of bones
    - long :: arms, legs
    - short :: wrist, feet
    - flat :: ribs, skull
    - regular :: all the rest

*** Connective tissues
- Bone :: Hard elements of the skeleton. Store minerals and produce the
     cellular components of blood.

     /Bones/ are hard because of nonliving extracellular crystals of calcium
      minerals; hard, rigid, appearance and feel. /Bones/ are living cells,
      and undergo constant replacement, remodeling, and repair.
  - support
  - protection
  - movement
- Long bone :: It is longer than it is wide, consists of a cylindrical
     shaft /*diathesis*/, and an enlarged knob called an /*epiphysis*/.
- Compact bone :: Forms the shaft and covers each end.
  - Osteocytes :: Mature bone cells that maintain the structure of bone.
       The /compact bone/ is made up largely of extracellular deposits of
       calcium phosphate enclosing and surrounding living cells.
    - Greek /osteo/ bone /cyte/ cell
  - Osteons :: [Haversian systems] Osteocytes arranged in rings in
       cylindrical structures.
  - Central canal :: [Haversian canal] /Ostecytes/ nearest the center of an
       /osteon/ receive nutrients from diffusion from blood vessels.

  - Spongy bone :: Inside each epiphysis. It is a latticwork of hard,
       relatively string /trabeculae/ (Latin "little beams") composed of
       calcium minerals and living cells.

       /*note*/ Spongy bone doesn't need to rely on central canals for
       nutrients and waste removal. The slender /trabecular/ structure of
       spongy bone gives each osteocyte access to nearby blood vessels in red
       bone marrow.

       A /trabecular/ structure is a latticework of interconnected beams.

- Joint :: The point of contact between bones.

- Ligaments :: Dense, fibrous connective tissue that attach bone to bone.
     They are a regular array of closely packed collaen fibers all oriented
     in the same direction, with just a few /fibroblasts/ in between.

     /Ligaments/ are slow to heal because they have very few living cells and
     a poor blood supply.

- Cartilage :: Specialized connective tissue consisting primarily of fibers
     of collagen and elastic in a gel-like fluid called /ground substance/.

  - Fibrocartilage :: Collagen fibers arranged in thick bundles.
  - Hyaline cartilage :: Smooth, glassy cartilage of thin collagen fibers.
  - Elastic cartilage :: Mostly elastin fibers, so it is highly flexible.

*** Bone development
    At the earliest stages of fetal development, before organs develop, we have
    /chondroblasts/. After about two to three months of fetal development,
    /ossification/ happens.

    - Chondroblasts :: Cartilage-forming cells that build a model of the future
         bone. These /chrondroblasts/ are rudimentary models of future bones and
         are created out of /hyaline cartilage/.

    - Ossification :: Chondroblasts slowly die out and the cartilage models
         begin to dissolve and are replaced by bone.

    - Osteoblasts :: _Young bone-forming_ cells that cause the hard extracellular
         matrix of bone to develop.

         They secrete both /osteoids/, and /hydroxyapatite/. In _mature_ /compact bone/,
         approximately one-third of the structure is /osteoid/ and two-thirds is
         crystals of /hydroxyapatite/.

         Eventually, the rate at which /osteoblasts/ produce the /osteoid/
         matrix and stimulate the mineral deposits declines, and /*osteoblasts*/
         *become* mature /*osteocytes*/ embedded in their individual /lacunae/.

      - Osteoid :: Mixture of proteins that forms a matrix that provides
           internal structure and strength to bone.

      - Hydroxyapatite :: Hard mineral salts of calcium phosphate

    - Osteclasts :: Bone-dissolving cells.

         Cut through mature bone tissue, dissolving the /hydroxyapatite/ and
         digesting the /osteoid/ matrix in their path. The released calcium and
         phosphate ions enter the blood.

         The areas from which bone has been removed attract new osteoblasts,
         which lay down new osteoid matrixes and stimulate the deposition of new
         hydroxyapatite crystals.

    - Growth plate :: [epiphyseal plate] A narrow stip of /cartilage/ that
         remains in each /epiphysis/. This is where there is bone on one side,
         and cartilage on the other side.

    - Osteoporosis :: Common bone disease in which bones lose a great deal of
         bone mass (seemingly becoming "porous"). The honeycomb shape of bone
         becomes more porous for those with /osteoporosis/.

    - Hematoma :: Mass of clotted blood

    - Fibrocarttilage callus :: When a bone breaks, this forms between the
         broken ends and is later replaced with bone.

    - Parathyroid hormone :: [PTH] stimulates the /osteoclasts/ to secrete more
         bone-dissolving enzymes.

    - Calcitonin :: stimulates /osteoblast/ activity, causing calcium and
         phosphate to be removed from blood and deposited in bone.

*** Skeletal system
The /skull/ and /vertebral column/ protect the /brain/ and /spinal cord/,
the /rib cage/ protects the organs of the chest cavity, and the /pelvic
girdle/ supports the body's weight and protects the pelvic organs. The upper
limbs are capable of a wide range of motions (dexterous movement). The lower
limbs are stronger but less dexterous than the upper limbs
- Axial skeleton :: 80 bones, including the skull, vertebral column, ribs,
     and sternum.
  - Cranium :: [skull] Comprises over two dozen bones that protect the brain and
       form the structure of the face.
  - Cranial bones :: Flat bones in the skull that enclose and protect the brain.

         sockets.
    - Parietal bones :: [two] Upper left and right sides of the skull.
    - Temporal bones :: [two] Forms the lower left and right sides of the skull.
    - Sphenoid bone :: Forms the back of both eye sockets.
    - Ethmoid bone :: Contributes to the eye sockets and also helps support the
         nose.
    - Nasal bones :: [two] Small, narrow; underlie only the upper bridge of the
         nose; the rest of the fleshy protuberance called the nose is made up of
         cartilage and other connective tissue.
    - Lacrimal bones :: [small] At the inner eye socket, are pierced by a tiny
         opening through which the tear ducts drain tears from the eye sockets
         into the /nasal cavity/.
    - Mandible :: [lower jaw] Contains the sockets that house the lower row of
         teeth.
    - Occipital bone :: Curving underneath to form the back and base of the
         /skull/.
    - Foramen magnum :: [Latin "great opening"] Where the /vertebral column/
         connects to the /skull/ and the /spinal cord/ enters the /skull/ to
         communicate with the brain.
  - Facial bones :: compose the front of the skull.
    - Maxilla :: On either side of the nose, forming part of the eye sockets and
         contain the sockets that anchor the upper row of teeth.
    - Palatine bones :: [two] Irregular bones, comprise the hard palate at
         the back part of the nasal cavity.
    - Zygomatic bones :: [cheekbone or malar bone] paired bone which
         articulates with the maxilla.
  - Sinuses :: Air spaces in the /cranial/ and /facial bones/ that make the
       skull lighter and give the human voice its characteristic tone and
       resonance.

       Each sinus secretes /mucus/, a thick, sticky fluid that helps trap
       foreign particles in incoming air. They connect to the /nasal cavity/
       via small passageways through which the mucus normally drains.
  - Hyoid bone :: Does not make direct contact with other bones of the
       /axial skeleton/; it is attached to the /temporal bone/ only by
       /ligaments/. Serves as a point of attachment for muscles of the
       /tongue/, the /larynx/, and the /pharynx/.
  - Vertebral column :: The body's main axis. It _supports_ the head,
       _protects_ the /spinal cord/, and serves as the site of _attachment_
       for the four limbs and various muscles. It has 5 anatomical regions.

       Neighboring vertebrae are separated from each other by a flat,
       elastic, compressible /*intervertebral disk*/ composed of a soft,
       gelatinous center and a tough outer layer of /fibrocartilage/.
    - Cervical vertebrae :: [7 vertebrae] Neck
    - Thoracic vertebrae :: [12 vertebrae] The chest or thorax
    - Lumbar vertebrae :: [5 vertebrae] Lower portion or "small" of the back
         which forms the lumbar curve of the spine
    - Sacral :: [5 vertebrae fused] In the /sacrum/ or upper pelvic region
    - Coccygeal :: [4 vertebrae fused] The /coccyx/ or tailbone. It is an
         example of a /vestigial structure/.
  - Ribs :: One end of each rib branches from the /thoracic/ region of the
       /vertebral column/. The other ends of the upper seven pairs attach
       via /cartilage/ to the /sternum/.

       Humans have 12 pairs of ribs.
  - Sternum :: [breastbone] A flat blade-shaped bone composed of three
       separate bones that fuse during development.
- Appendicular skeleton :: {Pectoral girdle, pelvic girdle, and limbs}
     Consists of those parts of the body that attach, or are appended to,
     the /axial skeleton/. Includes the arms, legs, and their attachments to
     the trunk, which are the /pectoral/ and /pelvic girdles/.
  - Pectoral girdle :: Lends flexibility to the upper limbs. 
    - Clavicle :: [collar bone] Extend across the top of the chest and
         attach to the /scapulas/.

         Most frequently broken bone.
    - Scapula :: [shoulder blade] The triangular bones in the upper back.
  - arm and hand :: Consists of 30 different bones.

       The humerus is the first and meets at the scapula. The lower end of
       the /radius/ an /ulna/ meet the /carpal bones/. A group of eight
       small bones that make up the wrist. The five /metacarpal/ bones form
       the palm of the hand, and they join with the 14 /phalanges/, which
       form the fingers and thumb.
    - Humerus :: [upper arm] The long bone of the upper arm, fits into a socket in the
         /scapula/.
    - Ulna :: Meets with the other end of the humerus as does the /radius/.
         Bone of the forearm.

         The elbow around here is nicknamed the "funny bone."
    - Radius :: bone of the forearm.
    - Carpal :: [wrist]

         Repetitive motions can lead to health problems called /repetitive
         stress syndromes/. One well-known repetitive stress syndrome is
         /carpal tunnel syndrome/. Inflammation of the tendons causes them
         to press against the nerve supplying the hand, resulting in pain,
         tingling, or numbness in the wrist and hand.
    - Metacarpals :: [hand]
    - Phalanges :: [finger bones]
  - Pelvic girdle :: Supports the body, and consists of two /coxal/ bones
       and the /sacrum/ and /coccyx/ of the /vertebral column/. 

       The primary function of the pelvic girdle is to support the weight of
       the upper body against the force of gravity. The lower limbs are
       larger and more firmly connected to the rest of the body than the
       pectoral girdle and upper limbs.
    - Coxal bone :: Attach to the /sacral/ region of the /vertebral column/ in
         back, then curve forward to meet in from at the /pubic symphysis/,
         which is right around the groin it looks like, where they are joined
         by cartilage.
  - Femur :: [thighbone] Longest and strongest bone in the body. 

       The rounded upper end of each /femur/ fits securely into a socket in
       a /coxal bone/. The lower end of the femur intersects at the knee
       joint with the larger of the two bones of the lower leg, the /tibia/,
       which in turn makes contact with the thinner /fibula/.
  - Tibia :: [shinbone] Bigger lower leg bone in front.
  - Fibula :: [calf bone] Smaller of the two lower leg bones in the back.

       At the ankle, the /tibia/ and /fibula/ join with the seven /tarsal
       bones/ that make up the ankle and heel. Five long bones, the
       /metatarsals/, form the foot. The 14 bones of the toes, like those of
       the fingers, are called /phalanges/.
  - Patella :: [kneecap] A triangle-shaped bone that protects and stabilizes
       the knee joint.
  - Tarsals :: 
  - Metatarsals ::
  - Phalanges ::
*** Joints form connections between bones
    Structure and tissues that hold the skeleton together while still permitting
    us to move about freely: /joints/, /ligaments/, and /tendons/.

    Joints are points of contact between bones. Fibrous joints are immovable in
    adults, cartilaginous joints permit some movement, and synovial joints are
    highly movable. Synovial joints are held together by ligaments and
    lubricated by synovial fluid.

    - Joints :: {articulations} The points of contact between bones.

         Vary considerably from basically immovable to freely movable. Types of
         joints include /fibrous/, /cartilaginous/, and /synovial/ joints.

      - Fibrous joints :: Immovable.

      - Fontanels :: At birth, the flat bones in a baby's skull are separated by
           relatively large spaces filled with fibrous connective tissue. These
           "soft spots" are /fontanels/.

           The presence of joints also allows for brain growth and development
           after birth. During childhood these fibrous joints gradually harden.
           They are tiny, thin sutures by the time we are old.

      - Cartilaginous joints :: Bones are connected by /hyaline cartilage/, they
           are slightly movable and give some flexibility.

           Examples include the cartilaginous joints that connect the
           /vertebrae/ in the backbone, and those that attach the lower /ribs/
           to the /sternum/.

      - Synovial joints :: The most freely moving joints are these. Bones are
           separated by a thin fluid-filled cavity. The two bones are of a
           synovial joint are fastened together and stabilized by /ligaments/.

           The interior is lined with a /synovial membrane/ which secretes
           /synovial fluid/ to lubricate and cushion the joint. The
           /articulating/ surfaces of the two bones are covered with a tough but
           smooth layer of /hyaline cartilage/. Together the synovial membrane
           and the surrounding hyaline cartilage constitute the /joint capsule/.

           To reduce friction there are small disks of /cartilage/ on either
           side of the knee called /menisci/. The knee joint [hinge joint] also
           includes 13 small sacs of fluid, called /bursae/, for additional
           cushioning.

        - Synovial fluid ::

        - Synovial membrane ::

        - Joint capsule ::

        - Hinge joint :: Like the knee or elbow, gets its name because it allows
             movement in one plane like the hinges on a door.

        - Ball and socket joint :: Permits an even wider range of movement that
             the /hinge joint/.

             Thanks to its design, a synovial joint can withstand tremendous
             friction without wearing out. It gets its strength from
             /ligaments/, /tendons/, and /muscles/.

    - Ligaments and tendons :: Connective tissues that stabilize many joints.

         Ligaments and tendons contain collagen arranged in parallel fibers,
         making ligaments and tendons as strong and as flexible as a twisted
         nylon rope. You can test how good these things are by loosening up your
         legs and moving your /patella/ around. When you put tension in the
         ligaments and tendons again though it doesn't move.

*** Diseases and disorders of the skeletal system
** Ch. 6
*** Muscles produce movement or generate tension
      40% of body weight in males in muscle, 32% in females.

      - Skeletal muscles :: Most interact with the skeleton and cause bones to
           move (or to prevent them from moving) relative to each other.
        - Shivering, threading a needle, lifting heaving weights, standing
          completely still, etc. are all tasks accomplish be skeletal muscles.
        - We have more that 600 skeletal muscles, often organized into pairs or
          groups. Hundreds of muscles, each controlled by nerves and acting
          either individually or in groups, produce all possible human motions.
          Muscle groups that work together to create the same movement are
          called /synergistic muscles/. Muscles that oppose each other are called
          /antagonistic muscles/.
      - Smooth muscle :: [involuntary] Contracts/relaxes without your conscious
           though.
      - Cardiac muscle :: [involuntary muscle] Makes up the heart.
      - Skeletal muscle :: [voluntary] Muscle tissue that is typically attached
           to the skeletal muscle for movement.
      - Tendons :: Connects muscles to bones.
      - Ligaments :: Connects bones to bones.
      - Synergistic muscles :: Muscles that work together to create the same
           movement.
      - Antagonistic muscles :: Muscles that oppose each other.
      - Origin :: End of muscle that attaches to relatively stationary bone.
      - Insertion :: End of muscle attached to another bone across a joint; the
           "movable" end of the muscle.

**** Muscles
     Muscles either produce or resist movement. Their fundamental activity is
     /contraction/. A muscle is composed of many muscle cells arranged in
     parallel, each containing numerous /myofibrils/. The contractile unit in a
     myofibril is called a /sarcomere/. A sarcomere contains think filaments of a
     /protein/ called /myosin/ and thin filaments of a protein called /actin/.
    
***** Internal
      - Myofibrils :: The nuclei of singular muscle cells need to be located just
           under the cell membrane because nearly the entire interior of the cell
           is packed with these long cylindrical structures arranged in parallel,
           called /myofibrils/.

           Myofibrils are packed with contractile /proteins/ called /actin/ and
           /myosin/.

      - Sarcomere :: A segment of a /myofibril/ from one Z-line to the next is
           called a /sarcomere/.

           A /sarcomere/ consists of two kinds of /protein filaments/. Thick
           filaments composed of a protein called /myosin/ are interspersed at
           regular intervals within filaments of a different protein called
           /actin/.

        - Actin ::
        - Myosin ::

***** Specific muscles
      - Buccinator :: Thin quadrilateral muscle, occupying the interval between
           the maxilla and the mandible at the side of the face.

      - Orbicularis oris :: A complex of muscles in the lips that encircles the
           mouth.

      - Zygomaticus major ::
      - Frontalis ::
      - Orbicularis oculi ::
      - Masseter ::

      - Sternocleidomastoid ::
      - Pectoralis major :: Draws arm forward and toward the body
      - Deltoid :: Raises arm
      - Latissimus dorsi :: Rotates and draws arm backward and toward body
      - Trapezius :: Lifts shoulder blade, braces shoulder, draws head back.
      - Serratus anterior :: Helps raise arm, contributes to pushes, draws
           shoulder blade forward
         
      - External intercostals :: 
      - Rectus abdominis :: Compress abdomen, bends backbone, compresses chest
           cavity
      - External oblique :: Lateral rotation of trunk, compresses abdomen.
      - Transversus abdominis ::
      - Biceps brachii :: Straightens forearm at elbow
      - Triceps brachii :: Lifts shoulder blade, braces shoulder, draws head back.
           Rotates and draws arm backward and toward body.

      - Gluteus maximus :: Butt muscles; extends thigh, rotates thigh laterally.
      - Hamstrintgs :: helps your knee bend; draws thigh backward, bends knee
        - Biceps femoris :: [not important]
        - Semimembranosus :: [not important]
        - Semitendinosus :: [not important]
      - Adductor Longus :: Flexes thigh, rotates thigh laterally, draws thigh
           toward body. Inner thigh muscle.
      - Gastrocnemius :: Bends lower leg at knee, bends foot away from knee. Calf
           muscles

      - Quadriceps femorus :: Flexes thigh at hips, extends leg at knee. Front of
           upper leg area.

***** Always contract, never push
      - The can only Pull, never PUSH
      - Muscles contract in response to electrical or chemical stimuli.

**** another word to eat
     - mastication :: another word for eating.

          A lab T.A. said this would be on the test!

**** Movements
     - Flexion :: Decreases angle of the joint between two structures.

     - Extension :: Increases angle of the joint between two structures.

     - Abduction :: Moves bone away from the midline of the body.

     - Adduction :: Moves bone toward the midline of body ("add" to the body's
          midline).

     - Rotation :: Bone spins around its own axis.

     - Circumduction :: Bone describes a cone in three-dimensional space.

     - Supination :: Rotation of the forearm so palm faces anteriourly (imagine
          holding a bowl of soup).

     - Pronation :: Rotation of the forearm so palm faces posteriorly.

*** Individual muscle cells contract and relax
    During a muscle contraction each sarcomere shortens just a little. Subtle
    though this action seems, it is also powerful. The contraction of an entire
    skeletal muscle depends on the simultaneous shortening of the tiny
    sarcomeres in its cells.

    - A skeletal muscle cell must be activated by a nerve. It does not contract
      on its own.
    - Nerve activation increases the concentration of calcium (Ca) in the
      vicinity of the contractile proteins.
    - The presence of calcium permits contraction. The absence of calcium
      prevents contraction.
    - When a muscle cell is no longer stimulated by a nerve, contraction ends.

**** Nerves activate skeletal muscles
     - Motor neurons :: Skeletal muscle cells are stimulated to contract by
          these nerve cells.

          The motor neuron secretes /acetylcholine/ (ACh) a /neurotransmitter/.
          The nerve cell has only either an excitatory or inhibitory effect.

     - Neuromuscular junction :: The junction between a motor neuron and a
          skeletal muscle cell.

          /Acetylcholine/ is released when there are electrical impulses
          traveling in a motor neuron. Acetylcholine binds to receptor sites on
          the muscle cell membrane, causing muscle cell membrane to generate an
          electrical impulse traveling in all directions. /T tubules/ or
          /transverse tubules/ transmit these random electrical impulses to all
          parts of the cell as quickly as possible.

**** Activation releases calcium
     - Sarcoplasmic reticulum :: A series of membrane-bound chambers in close
          contact to transverse tubules. It is forced to fit into the small
          amount of space in the cell not occupied by myofibrils. The primary
          function of the sarcoplasmic reticulum is to store ionic calcium
          (Ca^{2+})

          Latin /sarco-/ flesh or muscle

**** Calcium initiates the sliding filament mechanism
     Contraction is inhibited unless calcium is present. Closely associated to
     the /actin/ and /myosin/ are two other /protein/ molecules called
     /troponin/ and /tropomyosin/, together /troponin-tropomyosin protein
     complex/. 

     - Sliding filament mechanism :: Muscles contract when sarcomeres shorten,
          and sarcomeres shorten when the thick and thin filaments slide past
          each other.

*The Immune System and Mechanisms of Defense*

- Pathogen :: Living organisms (bacteria) which cause disease.

     Note that not /all/ bacteria are pathogens. Indeed, some are highly
     beneficial.
     
*** Self vs. non-self
- B cell :: Each B cell produces unique B cell receptors which react only to
     specific antigens. (Also applicable to T cells.) Created in bone marrow
     with a random.

*** Pathogens cause disease

*** The lymphatic system defends the body

*** Keeping pathogens out: The first line of defense
Various mechanisms create an inhospitable environment for pathogenic
microorganisms. _Skin_ is a dry outer barrier. _Tears_, _saliva_, _earwax_, and _mucus_
trap pathogens or wash them away. _Acidic conditions_ kill them or inhibit their
growth; _urination_, _defecation_, and _vomiting_ forcibly expel them; and _resident
bacteria_ compete with pathogens for food.

Most successful /pathogens/ _enter_ the body at places _where_ we do _not_ have /skin/.
Enter through the mucous membranes that line the /digestive/, /urinary/,
/respiratory/, and /reproductive/ tracts; taking advantage of moist surfaces in
direct contact with living cells.

- Skin
  1. *structure* has /keratin/ which is good
  2. *constant replacement* sheds away pathogens on skin
  3. *acidic pH* Low pH makes skin a hostile environment for many microorganisms.
  4. production of *antibiotic* by sweat glands
- *tears*, *saliva*, and *earwax* contain /lysozyme/. Saliva lubricates, and prevents
  cracking.
- *Mucus* Thick, gel-like material secreted by cells at various surfaces of the
  body. Microorganisms coming in contact with mucus becomes mired and cannot
  gain access to the cells beneath.
- *Digestive* and *vaginal acids*. Undiluted, acids are strong enough to kill nearly
  all pathogens.
- *Vomiting*, *urination*, and *defecation*
- *Resident bacteria* Help control the population of deadly pathogens by competing
  with them successfully for food.


- Keratin :: Forms a dry, tough, somewhat elastic barrier to the entry of
     microorganisms.
- Lysozyme :: An enzyme that kills many bacteria.

*** Nonspecific defenses: The second line of defense
[[file:Ch. 9/immune_2016-11-16_23-18-44.png]]
Nonspecific defense mechanisms involve a general attack against all foreign and
damaged cells. /Neutrophils/ and /macrophages/ engulf and digest bacteria and
damaged cells, and /eosinophils/ bombard larger organisms (too large to be
engulfed) with digestive enzymes. The inflammatory response attracts /phagocytes/
and promotes _tissue healing_. /Interferons/ interfere with viral reproduction, and
a modest /fever/ enhances our ability to fight infections.

If /pathogens/ manage to breach our physical and chemical barriers and start to
kill or damage cells, there is a problem. The body must actively _seek out_ the
/pathogens/ and get rid of them, then _clean up_ the injured area and _repair_ the
damage. /Phagocytes/ are /white blood cells/ that destroy foreign cells through the
process of /phagocytosis/. A /phagocyte/ first captures a bacterium with its
cytoplasmic extensions, then draws the bacterium in, eventually engulfing it
(/endocytosis/) and enclosing it in a membrane-bound vesicle. Powerful enzyme in
the /lysosomes/ dissolve the bacterial membranes and then the WBC jettisons the
bacterial wastes (/exocytosis/).

- Monocyte :: (WBC) Largest type of leukocyte; can differentiate into
     macrophages.
- Phagocyte :: Cells which protect the body by ingesting (phagocytosing) harmful
     foreign particles.
- Phagocytosis :: Process in which white blood cells destroy foreign cells in
     the body by engulfing it inside a membrane and digesting it with enzymes.
- Lyososome :: Membrane-bound organelle found in animal cells. Spherical
     vesicles containing enzymes which break down virtually all kinds of
     biomolecules.
- Neutrophils ::  First white blood cells to respond to infection. Most abundant
     type of white blood cell.
- Macrophages :: White blood cells leaving the vascular system and entering into
     tissue fluids. They then engulf and digest large numbers of foreign cells,
     especially viruses and bacterial parasites. Technically no longer blood
     cells, as they're no longer in the blood.
[[file:Ch. 9/X2604-M-02_2016-11-16_23-20-10.png]]
- Eosinophils :: WBC which take on invaders too big for /phagocytosis/. They
     cluster around large parasites such as flukes and pinworms and bombard them
     with digestive enzymes. Also digest certain foreign /protein/.
[[file:Ch. 9/300px-Eosinophils_in_peripheral_blood_2016-11-16_23-16-38.jpg]]
- Inflammation :: Four outward signs: redness, warmth, swelling, and pain.
     Starts when tissue is injured. Triggers vasodilation which increases
     capillary permeability for phagocytes to squeeze through.
- Interferons :: Cells infected by viruses which secrete a group of proteins
     called /interferons/ which diffuse to _nearby healthy cells_, bind to their
     cell membranes, and stimulate the healthy cells to produce proteins that
     _interfere with_ the _synthesis_ of /viral proteins/, making it harder for the
     viruses to infect the protected cells.
- Complement system :: (?) Comprises at least 20 plasma proteins that circulate
     in the blood and complement, or assist, other defense mechanisms.
- Fevers :: 

*** Specific defense mechanisms: The third line of defense
[[file:Ch. 9/800px-Hematopoiesis_simple.svg_2016-11-16_23-24-26.png]]
An /antigen/ is any substance that provokes an /immune response/. When activated by
first exposure to a specific /antigen/, /lymphocytes/ called /B cells/ quickly produce
/antibodies/ against the /antigen/. They also produce a few long-lived /memory cells/
that remain inactive until the next exposure to the same /antigen/. Other
/lymphocytes/ called /T cells/ mature in the /thymus gland/. Helper /T cells/ stimulate
other immune cells, cytotoxic /T cells/ attack abnormal and foreign cells, and
memory /T cells/ store information until the next exposure to the same /antigen/.

[[file:Ch. 9/nonspecific-immune-response-3-638_2016-11-16_21-26-16.jpeg]] /First
exposure/ to a specific antigen generates a /primary immune response/. /Subsequent
exposure/ to the same antigen elicits a /secondary immune response/ that is faster,
longer lasting, and more effective than the primary immune response.

At first exposure to a particular antigen, the immune system generates a /primary
immune response/. This involves recognition of the antigen, and production and
proliferation of /B/ and /T cells/.

- Antigen :: A substance or part of a substance (living or non-living) that
     the /immune system/ recognizes as _foreign_. It _activates_ the /immune system/
     and _reacts_ with immune cells or their products, such as /antibodies/. 

     They are like keys for the lock, or antigen-binding site.
- Antibody :: A /protein molecule/ released by a /B cell/ or plasma cell that _binds
     to_ a specific /antigen/.
- Natural killer (NK) cells :: WBC (/lymphocytes/) which target destroy tumor
     cells and cells infected by viruses. NK cells are able to recognize certain
     changes that take place in the plasma membranes of tumor cells and
     virus-infected cells. "Natural killer" is more like "nonspecific killer."
     _Not_ phagocytes, instead they release chemicals that break down their
     targets' cell membranes.
- Immunity :: B and T cells create a population of memory cells. This is the
     /secondary immune response/ that is faster, longer lasting, and more
     effective than the first.

*** Immune memory creates immunity
*** Medical assistance in the war against pathogens

- Active immunization :: Induction of immunity after exposure to a an /antigen/.
     Can occur naturally or can be artificial.
- Vaccine :: Biological preparation that provides active acquired immunity to
     particular disease. An /artificial active immunization/.

*** Tissue Rejection: A medical challenge

*** Inappropriate immune system activity causes problems

*** Immune deficiency: The special case of AIDS

** Ch. 10
   *The Respiratory System: Exchange of Gases*
** Ch. 13
*The Endocrine System*

The /endocrine system/ triggers _sexual maturation_, sexual desire, _uterine
contractions_ during childhood, and milk letdown. It is involved in response to
stress, digestion, cellular metabolism, and overall organ growth and
development. Also is wholly or partly responsible for the maintenance of
homeostasis of many of the most important variables in the body, including salt
and water balance, blood pressure, the production of red blood cells, and blood
calcium concentration.

*** The endocrine system produces hormones
/Hormones/ are bloodborne units of information, just as /nerve impulses/ are units
of information carried in /nerves/. The hormones help to maintain /homeostasis/ by
regulating various body functions through /feedback loops/. /Hormones/ secreted by
glands of the /endocrine system/ act only on /target cells/ with appropriate
receptors. /Hormones/ reach their targets via the /circulatory system/, making
/endocrine system/ control slower than /nervous system/ control. The two systems
frequently interact.

*Endocrine has certain characteristics setting it apart from the nervous system
as a communications system*
1. /Hormones/ of the /endocrine system/ reach nearly every living cell. A distinct
   advantage over the nervous system. Hormones conveniently circulate in the
   /blood/ which is everywhere (except CNS).
2. Each /hormone/ acts only on certain cells. Each hormone acts only on a certain
   group of cells, called its /target cells/.
3. Endocrine control tends to be slower than nervous system. A consequence of
   using the cardiovascular system as the message delivery system. Endocrine is
   better with longer-term controls, such as regulation of blood pressure,
   production of red blood cells, and onset of puberty.
4. The /endocrine/ and /nervous systems/ can (and often do) interact with each
   other. The timing of growth and sexual maturation, for example, involves a
   complex sequence of changes in both neural and endocrine signals, and the
   release of some hormones depends on input from /sensory neurons/.


- Hormones :: Circulating chemical messenger molecules secreted by the /endocrine
     system/'s collection of /specialized cells/, /tissues/, and /glands/.
- Endocrine glands :: Where the /hormones/ are secreted. Ductless organs that
     secrete their products into interstitial fluid, lymph, and blood.
     - /endocrine/ means "secreted internally"
- Target Cells :: The specific cell in the body with the appropriate receptor
     for the targeting hormone. As an analogy consider a car needing a specific
     set of car keys; when the key is put into the ignition it causes the car to
     start up.

*** Hormones are classified as steroid or non-steroid
/Hormones/ participate in /negative feedback loops/. As messenger molecules, some
/hormones/ participate in internal /homeostatic/ control mechanisms and control
vital physiological processes (they maintain /homeostasis/). /Steroid hormones/
enter the /target cell/, activate specific genes, and cause the production of new
/proteins/. /Non-steroid hormones/ bind to a /cell membrane receptor/ that either
opens or closes ion channels or activates a /second messenger/ within the cell.

*note*: Most of the /hormones/ discussed in this chapter are non-steroid. The only
/steroid hormones/ are those produced by the cortex of the /adrenal gland/ (cortisol
and aldosterone) and the sex hormones produced by the /testes/ (testosterone) and
/ovaries/ (estrogen and progesterone).

[[file:Ch. 13/slide_8_2016-11-07_11-46-51.jpg]]

*A negative feedback loop involving a hormone.* In response to a change in the
controlled variable, the endocrine gland releases a hormone that acts on target
cells to return the controlled variable to its normal state. Any change in the
controlled variable sets in motion a response that reverses that change.

- Steroid hormones :: Structurally related to /cholesterol/ (a /lipid/), and
     therefore they are lipid-soluble. _Diffuses_ into the /target cells/.
     Hormone-receptor complex attaches to /DNA/, activating specific genes, then
     causing the formation of /messenger RNA/.
- Nonsteroid hormones :: Structurally related to /proteins/; therefore, /lipid/
     insoluble and cannot cross the /cell membrane/. _Bind to receptors_ on outer
     surface of /target cell membranes/. Some cause ion channels in the /cell
     membrane/ to open or close, _similar_ to the action of a /neurotransmitter/.
- Second messenger :: Commonly, hormone-receptor binding converts an inactive
     molecule within the cell into an active molecule. The activated molecule
     generated with the cell is this /second messenger/.

     A common second messenger is cyclic AMP, produced from ATP. Which then
     activates an enzyme already present within the cell, which activates
     another, which in turn activates another, and so on.

     ATP \rightarrow Cyclic AMP (/second messenger/) \rightarrow Enzyme 1 activated
     \rightarrow Enzyme 2 activated \rightarrow Enzyme 3 activated \rightarrow Final product alters cell
     activity

*** The hypothalamus and the pituitary gland
- 13.3 goes into a lot of hormones we do not need to know at this time like
  Pituitary Hormones
- focus on FSH and LH in conjunction with testosterone and negative feedback

Each anterior /pituitary hormone/ is produced and secrete by a separate cell type,
and each hormone is regulated by a separate mechanism. /FSH/ and /LH/ stimulate the
reproductive organs. They are called /gonadotropins/ because they stimulate the
growth, development, and function of the reproductive organs in both males and
females. In females, /FSH/ induces _egg development_, /LH/ promotes ovulation (egg
release), and both hormones stimulate the secretion of the ovarian hormone
/estrogen/. In addition, /LH/ stimulates the secretion of the ovarian hormone
/progesterone/ after ovulation. In males, /FSH/ induces _sperm development_ and /LH/
stimulates the production of the hormone /testosterone/ by the testes.
\\
\\
*FSH {pituitary gland} \rightarrow SPERM/EGGS* \\
*LH {pituitary gland} \rightarrow TESTOSTERONE/(OVULATION/PROGESTERONE)* \\

- Hypothalamus :: Small region of the brain that serves as a homeostatic control
     center.
- Pituitary gland :: (master gland) {hypophysis} /Endocrine gland/ the size of a
     pea and weighing 0.5 grams; protrusion off the _bottom_ of the /hypothalamus/
     at the _base_ of the /brain/. /Hormones/ _secreted_ from the pituitary gland help
     control: _growth_, _blood pressure_, certain functions of the _sex organs_,
     _thyroid glands_, and _metabolism_, as well as some aspects of _pregnancy_,
     _childbirth_, _nursing_, _water/salt_ concentration at the _kidneys_, _temperature
     regulation_ and _pain relief_.
- Follicle-stimulating hormone :: (FSH) {gonadotropin, glycoprotein polypeptide}
     Synthesized and secreted by the anterior /pituitary gland/. Regulates the
     _development_, _growth_, _pubertal maturation_, and _reproductive processes_ of the
     body.
- Luteinizing hormone :: (LH) {lutropin/lutrophin} Synthesized and secreted by
     the anterior /pituitary gland/. In females triggers ovulation. In males
     (where LH had also been called interstitial cell-stimulating hormone) it
     stimulates Leydig cell production of /testosterone/.

*** The pancreas secretes glucagon, insulin, and somatostatin
[focus on insulin]

/Endocrine cells/ of the /pancreas/ are located in small clusters scattered
throughout the pancreas called the /islets of Langerhans/. Insulin lowers glucose
levels by _facilitating /glucose/ uptake_ and _storage_.

1. Alpha cells secrete /glucagon/.
2. Beta cells secrete /insulin/, which _lowers blood sugar_. After a meal, /blood
   glucose/ levels _rise_ as /sugars/ are _absorbed_ from the digestive tract. The _high_
   glucose concentration _stimulates_ the /beta cells/ to _secrete_ /insulin/ into the
   blood, where it does the opposite of glucagon. /Insulin/ promotes the _uptake_ of
   /glucose/ by cells of the /liver/, /muscle/, and /fat tissue/. It also promotes the
   conversion of /glucose/ _into_ /glycogen/ in the liver, both /glycogen/ and /proteins/
   in muscle, and fats in /adipose tissue/.
3. Delta cells secrete somatostatin.


- Pancreas :: Both an /endocrine gland/ (secreting hormone into the blood) and an
     /exocrine gland/ (secreting /enzymes/, /fluids/, and /ions/ into the /digestive
     tract/ to aid in digestion).

- focus on testes and ovaries

The human /gonads/ are the /testes/ of males and /ovaries/ of females. Responsible for
the _production_ of /sperm/ and /eggs/; both organs are also /endocrine glands/ in that
they _produce_ the steroid /sex hormones/.

*During puberty*: In males, the /anterior pituitary gland/ begins to release
/luteinizing hormone/ (/LH/) which stimulates the testes to resume /testosterone/
production. In females, the /anterior pituitary/ starts to release /luteinizing
hormone/ (/LH/) and /follicle-stimulating hormone/ (/FSH/). These hormones stimulate
the ovaries to begin secreting /estrogen/ and /progesterone/.

[[file:book/screenshot_2016-11-10_22-49-30.png]]

- Testes :: Located in the /scrotum/, produce /androgens/, the male /sex hormones/.
- Ovaries :: Located in the abdomen, produces the female  sex hormones know
     collectively as /estrogens/ (/17b-estradiol/, /estrone/, and /estriol/), and also
     /progesterone/.

- How are macromolecules broken down, absorbed, and used?

/The digestive system/ and its accessory organs _digest_ and _absorb_ nearly
everything we eat and drink, regardless of how much we eat or drink. The stomach
_stores ingested food_ and _water_ until it can be _delivered_ to the /small intestine/;
also _secreting_ a _strong acid_ /hydrochloric acid/ (/HCL/) that breaks down proteins
and most bacteria. Leftover non-absorbed waste products and bacteria are stored
until they are eliminated as feces. Nutrients and water are absorbed in the
small intestine (and lesserly to the large intestine). /Enzymes/ from the /pancreas/
and the /small intestine/ _break down_ /carbohydrates/ and /fats/ to be absorbed. To
maintain a constant body weight, energy intake must equal energy expenditure.

In many ways the /digestive system/ is a highly efficient _disassembly line_, taking
in food and processing it, breaking it into small pieces and digesting the
fragments with /enzymes/ and /strong chemicals/.

- nutrients :: Substances in food that are required for growth, reproduction,
     and the maintenance of health.
- Salivary amylase :: Breaks down carbohydrates (generally polysaccharides which
     are a monosaccharide and dissacharide units linked by glycosidic bonds.)

*** The digestive system brings nutrients into the body

The digestive system consist of organs and accessory organs that share the
function of bringing nutrients into the body. The wall of the GI tract consists
of four tissue layers: the /mucosa/, the /submucosa/, the /muscularis/, and the
/serosa/. The five basic processes of digestion are:
1. mechanical processing and movement (mechanical digestion)
2. secretion
3. digestion (chemical digestion)
4. absorption
5. elimination


Accessory Organs
- Don't directly contact food
- Liver, Gallbladder, Pancreas, Salivary Glands

From the /esophagus/ to the /anus/, the walls of the /GI tract/ _share_ common
_structural features_ consisting of _four different layers_. Some of the organs of
the GI tract are separated from each other by thick rings of circular smooth
muscle called /sphincters/, which close off passageways between /organs/.

- The digestive system :: All the organs that share the common function of
     getting nutrients into the body. Including a series of hollow organs
     extending from the /mouth/ to the /anus/: the /mouth/, /pharynx/, /esophagus/,
     /stomach/, /small intestine/, /large intestine/, /rectum/, and /anus/.
- Gastrointestinal tract :: (/GI tract/) The organs of the /digestive system/
     creating a hollow tube through the body. The area through which food and
     liquids travel---the space within the tube---is called the /lumen/.
  - Mucosa :: (mucosal layer) Innermost tissue layer
  - Submucosa :: Next to the /mucosa/ is a _layer of connective tissue_ containing
       /blood vessels/, /lymph vessels/, and /nerves/, called the /submucosa/.
  - Muscularis :: Third layer of GI tract tissue responsible for motility or
       _movement_. Two r three sub-layers of /smooth muscle/.
  - Serosa :: Outermost layer of the GI tract wall is a _thin connective tissue
       sheath_ that _surrounds and protects_ the _other three layers_.


Five basic processes which accomplish digestive system function:
1. /Mechanical processing and movement/. Chewing breaks food into smaller pieces,
   and two types of movement (motility) mix the contents of the /lumen/ and
   propel it forward.
2. /Secretion/. Fluid, digestive /enzymes/, _acid_, alkali, bile, and mucus are all
   secreted into the GI tract at various places. In addition, several hormones
   that regulate digestion are secreted into the bloodstream.
3. /Digestion/. The contents of the /lumen/ are _broken down_ both _mechanically_ and
   _chemically_ into _smaller and smaller particles_, culminating in /nutrient
   molecules/.
4. /Absorption/. /Nutrient molecules/ pass across the /mucosal layer/ of the /GI tract/
   and into the /blood/ or /lymph/.
5. /Elimination/. _Undigested material_ is _eliminated_ from the body _via_ the /anus/.


The smooth muscle of the GI tract produces two kinds of motility, called
/peristalsis/ and /segmentation/. /Peristaltic waves/ of contraction ripple through
the organs of the /GI tract/, _mixing_ the contents of the /stomach/ and _pushing_ the
contents of the /esophagus/ and /intestines/ forward. Peristalsis is mostly
prevalent in the esophagus, where it transports food rapidly to the stomach.

- Peristalsis :: Propels food forward. The lump of food (/bolus/) is _pushed down_
     the /esophagus/ because of /smooth muscle/ _contracting before_ the /bolus/ and
     _relaxing after_ the /bolus/ around the portion of /GI tract/ near the /bolus/.
- Segmentation :: Mixes food. Short sections of /smooth muscle/ _contract_ and _relax_
     in _seemingly random_ fashion. The result is a _back-and-forth mixing_ of the
     contents of the /lumen/.

**** Other
- Small intestine :: _Digests_ /proteins/, /fats/, and /carbohydrates/. _Absorbs_ most of
     the /water/ and /nutrients/. _Secretes_ digestive /hormones/ and /enzymes/.
- Sigmoid colon :: Stores feces.
- Rectum :: Passageway for feces.
- Anus :: Expels undigested material.

*** The mouth processes food for swallowing
The four kinds of teeth (/molars/, /premolars/, /canines/, and /incisors/) _mechanically
digest_ chunks of food. /Salivary glands/ _secrete_ /saliva/, which _moistens food_,
begins the _chemical digestion_ of /carbohydrates/, _maintains_ the /pH/ of the /mouth/,
and _protects_ the teeth _against_ /bacteria/.

The mouth is the entrance to the /GI tract/. /Digestion/ begins in the /mouth/ with
the _process of chewing_, which breaks food into _smaller and smaller_ chunks. The
/mouth/ functions as an effective _food processor_. Chewing would be inefficient
without the muscular tongue, which positions food over the teeth and mashes it
against the roof of the mouth.

- Mouth :: Teeth chew food. /Tongue/ _positions_ and _tastes_ foods.
  1. *Molars (12)* flat surfaces well adapted to grinding and crushing 
  2. *Premolars (8)* 
  3. *Canines (4)* tear food
  4. *Incisors (8)* sharp-edged cut food
- Salivary glands :: (three pairs) Produce a watery fluid called /saliva/. Saliva
     moistens food, making it easier to chew and swallow.

*** The pharynx and esophagus deliver food to the stomach
/Swallowing/ begins with _voluntary movements_ of the /tongue/; the presence of food
_initiates_ an _involuntary swallowing reflex_. /Peristalsis/ and gravity _transfer_
food through the /esophagus/ _to_ the /stomach/.

_Voluntary movements_ of the /tongue/ and /jaws/ _push_ a /bolus/ of food into the
/pharynx/, stimulating receptors that initiate the "swallowing reflex," an
involuntary act that cannot be stopped once it is started. This _closes off_ the
passageways for air by closing off the passageway into the /nasal cavity/ and
bending the /epiglottis/ down to close the airway to the /trachea/, temporarily
halting breathing.

- Pharynx :: (throat) Tongue pushes food down this to swallow.
- Esophagus :: Just beyond the /pharynx/ is the /esophagus/, a _muscular tube_
     consisting of both /skeletal/ and /smooth muscle/ that _connects_ the /pharynx/
     to the /stomach/.

*** The stomach stores food, digests protein, and regulates delivery
The /stomach/ _stores_ food, _digests_ it, and _regulates_ its delivery to the /small
intestine/. /Gastric juice/ _dissolves_ /connective tissue/, large /proteins/, and
_peptides_ in food. The presence of _food stretches_ the /stomach/ and _increases_
/peristalsis/. /Peristaltic contractions/ _mix_ the /chyme/ and _push_ it gradually _into_
the /small intestine/.

The stomach is a muscular, expandable sac that performs the following three
important functions
1. *Food storage*. The /stomach/ _stores_ food until it can be digested and absorbed.
   The /stomach/ _shrinks when empty_, and then _expands_ to 1--3 liters of capacity
   _when eating_.
2. *Digestion*. The /stomach/ _digests_ /proteins/, using strong /acid/, and
   protein-digesting /enzymes/. The strong /acid/ also _kills most bacteria_. _Muscle
   contractions mix_ the secretions (/acids/, /enzymes/) with food, assisting in
   mechanically _breaking apart food particles_, and _push the mixture_ into the
   /small intestine/.
3. *Regulation of delivery*. The /stomach/ _regulates_ the _rate_ at which food is
   _delivered_ to the /small intestine/.


*Gastric Juice breaks down the proteins.* Some of the cells lining the glands in
the lining of the stomach secrete either /hydrochloric acid/ (/HCL/) or /mucus/, but
most secrete /pepsinogen/. Typically, the /stomach/ produces 1--2 liters of /gastric
juice/ per day, most of it immediately after meals, making the /stomach pH/
approximately 2.

Some of the cells lining the /stomach/ and /gastric glands/ continuously _produce_ a
_protective barrier_ of /mucus/, _preventing_ the /stomach/ from _digesting itself_.

- Stomach ::  Muscular, expandable sac.
- Pepsinogen :: /Pepsin's/ proenzyme released by the chief cells in the stomach
     wall which activates in the presence of /hydrochloric acid/ of the /gastric
     juice/.
- Pepsin :: Becomes a protein-digesting /enzyme/ from /pepsinogen/ which is secreted
     by the cells lining the /gastric glands/ after being exposed to /acid/ in the
     /stomach/.
- Chyme :: Watery mixture of _partially digested food_ and _gastric juice_ delivered
     to the /small intestine/. The /pyloric sphincter/ between the /stomach/ and the
     /small intestine/ regulates the rate of transport of /chyme/ into the /small
     intestine/.
  - Cardiac sphincter :: Prevents acid reflux into /esophagus/
  - Pyloric shpincter :: Regulates passage of chyme to /small intestine/.
- Peptic ulcer :: Open, (sometimes) bleeding _sore_ which occasionally occur in
     the /esophagus/ and upper part of the /small intestine/ as well.


*Stomach contractions mix food and push it forward*. While _empty_, the /stomach's/
_muscle contractions_ keep it _small_. When eating, the _muscle contractions cease_
and /stomach/ _relaxes_, _signaling_ /peristalsis/ to _increase_. /Chyme/ with a _high acid_
or _fat_ content _stimulates_ the _release_ of /hormones/ that _slow_ /stomach peristalsis/.

*** The small intestine digests food and absorbs nutrients and water
The /small intestine/ has two major functions: 1) _digesting_ /proteins/,
/carbohydrates/, and /lipids/, and 2) _absorbing_ approximately _90%_ of the /nutrients/
and /water/ we consume. Projections called /villi/ in the /mucosa/ _increase_ the /small
intestine's/ _surface area_ for absorption.

The process of _digestion continues_ in the /small intestine/. It has two major
functions:
1. /Digestion/. The /stomach/ partially _digests_ /proteins/ to smaller /peptides/, under
   the _influence of_ strong /acids/ and /pepsin/. /Protein/ _digestion continues_ in the
   /small intestine/, but also _digests_ /carbohydrates/ and /lipids/. Digestion of
   /protein/, /carbohydrates/, and /lipids/ in the /small intestine/ involves
   _neutralizing_ the highly acidic /gastric juice/ and _adding_ additional digestive
   /enzymes/ from the /intestine/ and /pancreas/.
2. /Absorption/. Eventually, the /proteins/, /carbon/, and /lipids/ in food are _broken
   down_ to single /amino acids/, /monosaccharides/, /fatty acids/, and /glycerol/, which
   are small enough to be _transported_ (i.e. NOT DIFFUSED) across mucosal cells
   into the blood. Nearly 90% of the /nutrients/ able to be absorbed and /water/ is
   _absorbed in_ the /small intestine/.


The /small intestine/ consists of three different regions. The /duodenum/, the
/jejunum/, the /ileum/.

- Duodenum :: About _10 inches long_. Most of the /digestion/ _takes place_ here. The
     /products of digestion/ are _absorbed_ primarily in the _other two segments_, the
     /jejunum/ and the /ileum/, which together are about _10 feet long_.
- Peptide :: Basically just small /proteins/.
- Villus :: (plural: *villi*) The mucosa contains large folds covered with
     _microscopic projections_ called /villi/, which each /epithelial cell/ of the
     /villi/ has _dozens_ of even _smaller_, /cytoplasmic projections/ called
     /microvilli/. The folds increase the surface area for absorption.

*** Accessory organs aid digestion and absorption
The /pancreas/ _secretes_ /digestive enzymes/ and /sodium bicarbonate/. The /sodium
bicarbonate/ _neutralizes_ /stomach acid/, making the /digestive enzymes/ _more
effective_. The /liver/ _produces_ /bile/, which is _stored_ in the /gallbladder/ until
after a meal. The /liver/ also _produces_ /plasma proteins/; _inactivates_ /toxic
chemicals/; _destroys_ old /red blood cells/; _stores_ /vitamins/, /iron/, and certain
products of /metabolism/; and performs _other functions_ important for /homeostasis/.

The /digestive system/ has four /accessory organs/: /salivary glands/, /pancreas/,
/gallbladder/, and /liver/.

*The pancreas secretes enzymes and NaHCO_{3}*. The exocrine products of the
pancreas are:
1. /Sodium bicarbonate/. Except for /pepsin/, most /digestion enzymes/ work _best_ at a
   fairly _neutral /pH/_. /sodium bicarbonate/ from the /pancreas/ neutralizes the
   /stomach acid/ in the /small intestine/ so that further digestion can proceed.
2. /Digestive enzymes/
   - /proteases/ :: Enzymes that digest proteins.
   - /pancreatic amylase/ :: Continues the digestion of carbohydrates only
        partially accomlished by salivary amylase.
   - /lipase/ :: /Lipid-digesting enzyme/. The /small intestine/ does not have lipase,
        so the this _/pancreas/ product_ is important.

The /liver/ serves a number of functions that _maintain_ /homeostasis/:
- Storing fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) and iron.
- Storing glucose as glycogen after a meal, and converting glycogen to glucose
  between meals.
- Manufacturing plasma proteins, such as /albumin/ and /fibrinogen/, from /amino
  acids/.
- Synthesizing and storing some lipids.
- Inactivating many chemicals, including /alcohol/, /hormones/, /drugs/, and /poisons/.
- Converting /ammonia/ (/NH_{3}/), a toxic waste product of metabolism, into less
  toxic /urea/.
- Destroying worn-out red blood cells
 
/Liver/ injury can be particularly dangerous. Overexposure to /toxic chemicals/,
/medications/, or /alcohol/ _can damage_ the /liver/ because it takes up these
substances to "detoxify" them, _killing_ some /liver cells/ in the process.
Long-term exposure _can destroy_ enough /cells/ to _permanently impair_ /liver/
function, a condition known as /cirrhosis/.


- Pancreas :: Elongated organ which lies just behind the stomach. Secretes
     digestive /enzymes/ (/proteases/, /amylase/, /lipase/) into /small intestine/; most
     of the enzymes involved in digestion come from the pancreas (the small
     intestine contributes only a limited amount of protein- and
     carbohydrate-digesting enzymes). Secretes /sodium bicarbonate/ into /small
     intestine/ to _neutralize_ /stomach acid/. _Delivers_ /enzymes/ and /sodium
     bicarbonte/ to the /duodenum/ _via_ /ducts/. The most important hormones it
     secretes into the blood are /insulin/ and /glucagon/.

     The /pancreas/ is also an /exocrine gland/ that _produces_ and _secretes_ several
     products directly into /ducts/ _leading to_ the /digestive tract/.
- Sodium Bicarbonate ::  (Baking Soda) Natural substance in the body within the
     bloodstream that _regulates_ /pH/ as a counterbalance to acid build up. Also a
     first line of defense for a vast range of sickness like cancer, flu,
     diabetes, kidney disease, and the common cold.
- Liver :: Upper-right /abdominal cavity/. Produces /bile/ (/water/ and /electrolytes/,
     /cholesterol/, /bile salts/, /lecithin/, and /pigments/). Performs various
     functions associated with _processing_ and _storing_ /nutrients/.
- Bile :: Watery mixture containing /electrolytes/, /cholesterol/, /bile salts/
     _derived from_ /cholesterol/, a /phospholipid/ called /lecithin/, and /pigments/
     (primarily /bilirubin/) _derived from_ the breakdown of /hemoglobin/.
- Hepatic portal system :: Generally, a /portal system/ _carries_ /blood/ from one
     /capillary bed/ to another. Here, the hepatic portal system carries
     nutrient-rich blood directly from the digestive organs to the liver via the
     hepatic portal vein.
- Gallbladder :: /Bile/ produced by the /liver/ flows through /ducts/ to the
     /gallbladder/. _Stores_ and _concentrates_ /bile/. Delivers bile to the /duodenum/
     via the common /bile duct/. Concentrates /bile/ by _removing_ most of the /water/,
     then _stores_ the /concentrated bile/ until it is needed.

*** The urinary system contributes to homeostasis
*Organ systems involved in removing wastes and _maintaining homeostasis_ of /water/
and /solutes/.* The /kidneys/ of the /urinary system/ are the organs primarily
responsible for the _mainenance of homeostasis_ of water and solutes and for the
excretion of most waste products.

The /urinary system/ maintains a constant internal environment by _regulating_ /water
balance/ and body levels of /nitrogenous wastes/, /ions/, and other substances. It
_filters_ metabolic wastes from the /blood/ and /excretes/ them in /urine/. The major
/nitrogenous waste/ product is /urea/.

- The digestive system + nutrients + water \rightarrow food residues
- Lungs + O_{2} \rightarrow carbon dioxide gas
- Skin + heat \rightarrow water + salt
- liver + numerous inactivate-able substances \rightarrow (sometimes) bile in feces


*The kidneys regulate water levels*. The kidneys have a tremendous capacity to
adjust water excretion as necessary, from a minimum of about 1/2 liter per day
to nearly 1 liter per hour.

*The kidneys regulate nitrogenous wastes and other solutes*. The primary solutes
excreted by the /kidneys/ are /nitrogenous wastes/, excess ions, and trace amounts
of other substances. The normal _metabolism of proteins_ leaves us with _excess_
/nitrogenous wastes/, which must be /_excreted_/ by the /kidneys/.

+ It _regulates_ /urinary excretion/ of these /ions/:
  - NA^{+} and CL^{-} :: determine the volume of the extracellular fluids,
       including blood.
  - K^{+} :: Maintains electrical charges
  - CA^{2+} :: Important in nerve and muscle activity
  - H^{+} :: Maintains acid--base balance.
  - Creatinine :: Produced during metabolism of creatine phosphate which gives
       urine its yellow color


- Excretion :: Process that _removes wastes_ and excess materials from the body.
- Urinary system :: Consists of the two /kidneys/, the /ureters/, the /bladder/, and
     the /urethra/.
- Kidney :: Two /kidneys/ _produce urine_. carefully _regulate_ how much _water_ and
     _salt_ (/ions/) are /excreted/ in order to _maintain homeostasis_ of fluid volume
     and blood pressure. Retain within the body all three classes of /nutrients/
     (/carbohydrates/, /lipids/, and /proteins/)
  - Bowman's capsule :: Cup underneath the glomerulus which catches the
       filtrate(is this the right word?).
  - Bowman's space :: Space inside Bowman's capsule.
  - Endothelial cells :: (Renestrated, or has a lot of holes/pores)
  - Basement membrane :: membrane underneath the endothelial cells.
  - Tubular cells :: (epithelial cell) Action point at the end of Bowman's
       capsule.
- Urine :: Waste water and waste solutes (various ions, drugs, vitamins, toxic
     chemicals, virtually every small waste molecule produced anywhere in the
     body).
- Urea :: (H_{2}N--CO--NH_{2}). Created with water from ammonia molecules (which are
     toxic to cells) and carbon dioxide.
- Ammonia :: (NH_{4}^{+})
- Diuretics :: (called water pills) Any substance which promotes an increased
     production of urine. Treat a variety of conditions, such as high /blood
     pressure/, /glaucoma/, and /edema/. Help rid the body of salt (sodium) and
     water. /Kidneys/ release more sodium into /urine/.
- Persistent proteinuria :: Urine has proteins in it which are not supposed to
     be in urine. This might happen in somebody with /kidney disease/---as it is
     the job of the kidney not to put proteins in the urine.

*** Organs of the urinary system
Organs of the /urinary system/ include the /kidneys/, /ureters/, /bladder/, and /urethra/.
The /kidneys/ are the principal urinary organs, although they have several
_homeostatic functions_ as well. The /ureters/ transport /urine/ to the /bladder/, where
it is stored until carried by the /urethra/ to the body's eternal opening.

| Organ           |   | Function                                                   |

| Kidneys         |   | Excrete metabolic wastes, especially urea                  |
|                 |   | Maintain water and salt homeostasis                        |
|                 |   | Help regulate acid--base balance                           |
|                 |   | Help regulate blood pressure (produce renin, an enzyme)    |
|                 |   | Control RBC production (produce erythropoietin, a hormone) |
|                 |   | Activate vitamin D                                         |
|-----------------+---+------------------------------------------------------------|
| Ureters         |   | Transport urine to bladder                                 |
|-----------------+---+------------------------------------------------------------|
| Urinary bladder |   | Stores urine until excretion                               |
|-----------------+---+------------------------------------------------------------|
| Urethra         |   | Transports urine to outside the body                       |

*Kidneys: the principal urinary organs*

The /kidneys/ are located on either side of the _vertebral column_, near the
_posterior body wall_. A /renal artery/ and a /renal vein/ connect each kidney to the
aorta and inferior vena cava, respectively.

*Ureters transport urine to the bladder*

*Urinary bladder stores urine*

Consists of three layers of /smooth muscle/ lined on the inside by /epithelial
cells/. Typically holds about 600--1,000 ml of /urine/.

- Medulla ::
- Cortex ::
- Renal pelvis ::
- Ureter :: Muscular tube that transports urine to the bladder. About 10--15
     seconds a peristaltic wave of smooth muscle contraction occurs pushing
     urine from the 10-inch length of the /ureters/ to the /bladder/.
- Urethra :: During urination, /urine/ passes through /this/, a single, muscular
     tube extending from the /bladder/ to the body's external opening.

*** Nephrons produce urine
- Yeah, so I really doubt that most of the big words in the this section are
  actually going to be useful. Basically, there are nephrons in the kidney that
  pull blood into the kidney where the nephron then takes out a tiny piece of
  garbage and inserts it into the collecting duct with some water, calling it
  urine.

A nephron is the function unit of a kidney. A nephron tubule consists of a
glomerular capsule, where fluid is filtered, and four reguions in which the
filtrate is modified before it becomes urine: proximal tubule, loop of Henle,
distal tubule, and collecting duct. Blood flows to the glomerulus via the renal
artery and afferent arteriols. Peritubuluar capillaries carry the blood to the
proximal and distal tubules, and vasa recta supply the loops of Henle and
collecting ducts.

Each kidney contains approximately a million small functional units called
/nephrons/. An individual /nephron/ consists of a thin, hollow tube of /epithelial
cells/, called a /tubule/, plus the /blood vessels/ that supply the /tubule/.

*** Formation of urine: Filtration, reabsorption, and secretion
- In the first part, proteins are separated from the solutes and water; solutes
  and water placed into tubule. Most of what is extracted is then
  reabsorbed---nearly all the filtered water and sodium and all the major
  nutrients. In the third part, the waste products are placed into the tubule to
  be secreted as urine.

[[file:Ch. 15/figure_25_09_labeled_2016-11-16_20-43-29.jpg]]

*Figure 15.6* The three processes that contribute to the formation of urine.
1. *Glomerular filtration* The movement of a /protein/-free solution of fluid and
   solutes from the /glomerulus/ into the space within the /glomerular
   capsule/. Water, ions, glucose, amino acids, bicarbonate, and waste products
   (urea, creatinine) are _filtered_ from the /glomerular capillaries/ into the
   space within the /glomerular capsule/.
2. *Tubular reabsorption* The return of most of the fluid and solutes back into
   the /peritubular capillaries/ or /vasa recta/. Water, amino acids, glucose, most
   ions (including bicarbonate), and some urea are _reabsorbed_ back into the
   /peritubular capillaries/, primarily in the /proximal tubule/ but also in other
   /nephron/ segments.
3. *Tubular secretion* The addition of certain solutes from the /peritubular
   capillaries/ or /vasa recta/ into the tubule. Some drugs, waste products, and
   ions (primarily hydrogen, ammonium, and potassium) are /actively secreted/ from
   the /peritubular capillaries/ primarily into the /distal tubule/ but also in
   other /nephron/ segments.


- /Efferent/ arterial is much _narrower_ than the /afferent/ arterial, and the
  /efferent/ arterial has pretty _high pressure_. The kidneys thus do _not need_ to
  use any _energy_ in the _/filtration/ process_ because diffusion is so easy.

*The rate of filtration is regulated in two ways*:
- Under _resting conditions_, pressure-sensitive cells in the /arterioles/ and
  flow-sensitive cells in the /tubule/ walls can _release chemicals_ to _adjust the
  diameter_ of the /afferent arterioles/. These feedback mechanisms maintain a
  relatively constant rate of /glomerular filtration/, allowing the kidneys to
  carry out their regulatory functions.
- During times of stress (such as after an injury or while running a marathon),
  _blood flow_ to the /kidneys/ _falls_ substantially as blood is redistributed to
  more critical organs. The /sympathetic/ division of the /autonomic nervous system/
  constricts /afferent/ and /efferent/ /arterioles/, reducing blood flow and the rates
  of /glomerular filtration/ and urine formation. The /kidneys/ are unharmed because
  they do not need a high blood flow to survive, and the body can cut back on
  urine production temporarily without ill effects.
*** Disorders of the urinary system
** Ch. 16
- Oxytocin :: [hormone, neuropeptide, medication] Normally produced in the
     hypothalamus and released by the posterior pituitary. Plays a role in
     social bonding, sexual reproduction in both sexes, and during and after
     childbirth.

*** The male reproductive system delivers sperm
The male reproductive system comprises the /testes/, the /penis/, and associated
ducts and glands. /Semen/ consists of /sperm/ and three glandular secretions that
provide energy and the proper pH environment for the /sperm/ and also lubrication
for sexual intercourse. Millions of /sperm/ form every day throughout a man's
life; a typical ejaculate contains up to 300 million /sperm/. /Testosterone/
stimulates the growth and function of the male reproductive system, and
encourages aggressive and sexual behavior. Blood level of /testosterone/ are
regulated by a /negative feedback loop/ involving /GnRH/ from the /hypothalamus/ and
/LH/ and /FSH/ from the /anterior pituitary/.

- Sperm :: 
- Egg ::
- Testes :: 
- Scrotum :: 


Each testis is only about 2 inches long, but it contains over 100 yards of
tightly packed /seminiferous tubules/. Seminiferous tubules join to become the
/epididymis/.

- Seminiferous tubules :: Site of sperm production.
- Epididymis :: Tube that connects a /testicle/ to a /vas deferens/.
- Ductus (vas) deferens :: 
- Ejaculatory duct :: 

- Penis ::
- Erection ::
- Semen :: 

The entire process of sperm formation and maturation takes about 9--10 weeks.

- Seminal vesicles :: Produce seminal fluid, a watery mixture containing
     fructose and prostaglandins that represents about 60% of the volume of
     semen.
- Prostate gland ::
- Bulbourethral glands ::
- Gametes :: Cells having only 23 chromosomes. Female gametes are called
     /oocytes/.
- Sertoli cells :: Large cells which nourish spermatogonia which are to begin
     sperm.

- Testosterone ::
- Gonadotropin-releasing hormone :: (GnRH)
- Luteinizing hormone :: (LH)
- Inhibin :: Highly active sertoli cells secrete a hormone called inhibin that
     directly inhibits the secretion of FSH.

*** The female reproductive system produces eggs and supports pregnancy
The /ovaries/ secrete /estrogen/ and /progesterone/, store immature /oocytes/, and
(usually) release one /oocyte/ at a time at intervals of about 28 days. The /oocyte/
travels through the /oviduct/ to the /uterus/, where implantation occurs if the egg
has been fertilized. The /vagina/ is the female organ of sexual intercourse and
the birth canal; around its opening are the structures of the /vulva/. /Mammary
glands/ are accessory organs that produce and store milk.

- Oviduct :: The tube through which an /ovum/ or egg passes from an /ovary/. In
     female mammals this passageway is know as the /uterine tube/ or /Fallopian
     tube/.
- Ovaries ::
- Estrogen ::
- Progesterone ::
- Oviduct ::

- Uterus ::
- Endometrium ::
- Cervix ::
- Vagina ::
- Labia majora :: Two prominent longitudinal cutaneous folds that extend
     downward.
- Labia minora :: (inner labia) Folds of skin in the very middle of /vulva/
     between thicker /labia majora/.
- Clitoris ::

- Mammary glands :: Accessory organs that produce and store milk.
- Lactation :: 

*** Menstrual cycle consists of ovarian and uterine cycles
During the /ovarian cycle/, a primary /oocyte/ within a developing /follicle/ divides
once to form a secondary /oocyte/. The /follicle/ ruptures, releases the /oocyte/, and
forms the /corpus luteum/ that secretes /progesterone/ and /estrogen/. Rising levels
of /estrogen/ cause the /endometrium/ to proliferate. If pregnancy does not occur,
hormone levels fall and the /endometrial layer/ disintegrates and is shed, a
process known as /menstruation/. /Ovulation/ is triggered by a surge of /LH/, which in
turn is caused by the /positive feedback/ effect of a high concentration of
/estrogen/ from the maturing /follicle/. During the second half of the /menstrual
cycle/, sustained high levels of /estrogen/ and /progesterone/ from the /corpus luteum/
inhibit further /ovulation/.

*** Human sexual response, intercourse, and fertilization
Women and men experience the same four phases of sexual responsiveness. Sexual
arousal in the male results in penile erection that leads to orgasm and
ejaculation. Females experience sexual arousal and pleasurable orgasms marked by
rhythmic muscular contractions. During ejaculation, the male deposits several
hundred million sperm in the vagina. Fertilization of the egg by a single sperm
occurs within five days, if it occurs at all.

- Orgasm ::
- Ejaculation :: 

*** Birth control methods: Controlling fertility
Surgical sterilization should be considered a permanent method of birth control.
Hormonal methods---pills, injections, patches, and rings---are also relatively
effective but can have side effects. Physical barriers (diaphragms, cervical
caps, and condoms) and chemical spermicides are moderately effective; a few
afford some protection against diseases. IUDs are fairly effective against
pregnancy but do not protect against diseases. Withdrawal and periodic
abstinence are not effective forms of birth control in the long term. Abortion
is an elective but controversial procedure that terminates a pregnancy.

*** Infertility: Inability to conceive
Male infertility is an insufficiency or lack of sperm. Causes of female
infertility are variable and include failure to ovulate, damage to oviducts,
pelvic inflammatory disease, secretions that impair sperm function, uterine
tumors, endometriosis, age-related changes, and miscarriages. The choice of
options to improve fertility depends on the cause of the infertility. Options
include artificial insemination, in vitro fertilization, gamete intrafallopian
transfer, zygote intrafallopian transfer, fertility-enhancing drugs, and
surrogate motherhood.

*** Sexually transmitted diseases
Major bacterial STDs include gonorrhea, syphilis, and chlamydia. The most
dangerous viral STD is HIV. Hepatitis BUT can be prevented by a vaccine. Genital
herpes is irritating but not particularly deadly. HPV can cause warts and is a
risk factor for cervical cancer---it, to, can be prevented by a vaccine. Yeast,
normally present in the vagina, can multiply and cause a yeast infection. Pubic
lice are tiny arthropods that are transmitted during intimate contact or by
contact with clothes or bedding. You can reduce your risk of contracting an STD
with a little effort. Choose your partner wisely, use a barrier method of birth
control, and , if you suspect you have a disease, get tested promptly.

** Ch. 8
   - Cardiovascular system :: Provides the power to move the blood, and the
        vascular system represents the network of branching conduit vessels
        through which the blood flows.
     - Greek /kardia/, hear Latin /vasculum/ small vessel

*** Blood vessels transport blood
A branching system of thick-walled /arteries/ _distributes blood_ to every area of
the body. /Arterioles/ _regulate blood flow_ to local regions, and precapillary
sphincters/ _regulate flow_ into individual /capillaries/. Capillaries/ consisting
of a single layer of cells exchange materials with the /interstitial fluid/. The
/lymphatic system/ _removes excess fluid_. The thin-walled /veins/ _return blood_ to the
heart and serve as a volume reservoir for blood.

A branching network of blood vessels transports blood to all parts of the body.
The network is so extensive that if our blood vessels were laid end to end, they
would stretch 60,000 miles!

There are three major types of blood vessels: /arteries/, /capillaries/, and /veins/.
Thick-walled arteries transport blood to body tissues under high pressure. As
blood leaves the heart it is pumped into the large, muscular arteries.

- Arteries :: Transport blood away from the heart. Larger arteries have a thick
     muscle layer because they need to withstand high pressure from the heart.

     The vessel is a sandwich of three distinct layers surrounding the /lumen/, or
     hollow interior of the vessel:
  1. /endothelium/.
  2. Largest layer of _smooth muscle_ with interwoven elastic _connective tissue_.
  3. Outermost layer of large and medium-sized arteries have a tough supportive
     layer of _connective tissue_, primarily collagen.

- Aneurysm :: [ballooning of the artery wall] The /endothelium/ becomes damaged,
     blood seeps through the injured area and the two outer layer, splitting
     them apart.
- Endothelium :: /Squamous/ /epithelial cells/ in a thin, flattened layer. A
     _continuation of_ the lining of the _heart_.
- Capillary :: /Epithelial cells/ of capillary /endothelium/.

*** Arterioles and precapillary sphincters regulate blood flow
    Eventually blood reaches the _smallest_ arteries, or /arterioles/.

    - Precapillary sphincter :: Smooth muscle that serves as gates for
         controlling blood flow into individual capillaries.
      - Vasoconstriction :: /Arterioles/ and /precapillary sphincters/ reduce
           diameter \rightarrow reduces blood flow.
      - Vasodilation :: /Arterioles/ and /precapillary sphincters/ increase diameter
           \rightarrow increase blood flow.
    - Arterioles :: Little /arteries/. Simpler in structure than arteries because
         they don't need to support as much pressure as arteries do. The
         diameter is control by /smooth muscle/ control, the /precapillary
         sphincters/.

*** Capillaries: Where blood exchanges substances with tissues
Porous walls allow blood to _exchange_ /oxygen/, /carbon dioxide/, /nutrients/, and
waste/ products with /tissue cells/.

[[file:Ch. 8/slide_19_2016-10-25_22-44-43.jpg]]
    
- Capillaries :: Thin-walled vessels about as think as the /red blood cells/
     that travel through them. Biological strainers that permit selective
     _exchange_ of substances with the /interstitial fluid/.
- Capillary beds :: Found in all areas of the body. Capillary walls consist
     of a single layer of /squamous epithelial cells/.

*** Lymphatic system helps maintain blood volume
    The /lymphatic system/ is somewhat similar to the venous system of blood
    vessels, except that the fluid it contains /lymph/ does _not_ contain /plasma
    proteins/ or /red blood cells/.

    - Lymphatic system :: Collection system of larger vessels where excess
         plasma fluid is absorbed by blind-ended capillaries.

*** Veins return blood to the heart
    Blood flows back to the heart through /venules/ (small veins) and /veins/. Has
    _three layers_ similar to /arteries/, but much _thinner_. Veins have a _larger_
    /_lumen_/, however.

    Pressure goes down as it moves through the cardiovascular system, so veins
    require only a small fraction of the pressure in arteries. Veins accommodate
    _large volumes_ of blood at _low pressures_.

    Most veins contain valves consisting of small folds of the inner layer that
    protrude into the lumen; permitting only one-way flow.

    - Veins :: Carries blood to the heart.

         Blood pools into your legs and feet when standing upright. People who
         spend a lot of time on their feet may develop /varicose veins/.

    - Vericose veins :: Permanently swollen veins that look twisted and bumpy
         from pooled blood.

*** The heart pumps blood through the vessels
The heart wall consists of _three layers_: the /epicardium/, the /myocardium/, and
the /endocardium/. The heart contains _four chambers_ and _four one-way valves_.
The /right atrium/ and /right ventricle/ pump blood _to_ the /lungs/; the /left
atrium/ and /left ventricle/ pump blood _to_ the rest of the /body/. Each /cardiac
cycle/ is a repetitive sequence of contraction (/systole/) and relaxation
(/diastole/).

The /heart/ is located in the /thoracic cavity/ _between_ the /lungs/ and behind the
sternum/, or breastbone. It consists mostly of /cardiac muscles/.

- Cardiac muscle :: Doesn't connect to bone. _Pumps_ ceaselessly in a
     squeezing motion to _propel blood_ through the /blood vessels/.
- Pericardium :: Tough, fibrous sac. _Protects_ the /heart/, _anchors_ it to
     surrounding structures, and _prevents_ it from _overfilling_ with blood.
- Pericardial cavity :: Contains a film of lubricating fluid that reduces
     friction and allows the /heart/ and the /pericardium/ to glide smoothly
     against each other when the heart contracts.

There are three layers in the walls of the heart.

    
    [[file:Ch. 8/The-pericardial-layers-and-layers-of-the-heart-wall_2016-10-25_22-42-22.jpg]]

- Epicardium :: Outermost layer consisting of a _thin layer_ of /epithelial/ and
     /connective tissue/.
- Myocardium :: Middle layer consisting mainly of /cardiac muscle/ that forms
     the bulk of the heart. The layer that _contracts_ every time the heart
     beats.
- Endocardium :: Innermost, thin /endothelial/ layer resting on a layer of
     /connective tissue/. Continuous with the /endothelium/ that lines the blood
     vessels.

Problems*

- Pericarditis :: Inflammation of the /pericardium/.

*** The heart has four chambers and four valves
    /Blood/ _returning_ to the /heart/ from the body's tissues _enters_ the heart at the
    /right atrium/. From the right atrium, the blood passes through a valve _into_
    the /right ventricle/. The right ventricle is more muscular than the right
    atrium because it pumps blood at considerable pressure through a second
    valve and _into_ the /artery/ leading _to_ the /lungs/.

    /Blood/ _returning from_ the /lungs/ _to_ the /heart/ _enters_ the /left atrium/, then
    passes through a third valve _into_ the /left ventricle/. The very muscular left
    ventricle pumps blood through a fourth valve _into_ the body's _largest_ /artery/,
    the /aorta/.

    [[file:Ch. 8/13453870-Schematic-representation-of-the-human-circulatory-system-Poster-Stock-Vector_2016-10-25_23-00-21.jpg]]

    - Atria :: [two atria, each an atrium] Each goes to the corresponding
         ventricle. Body attaches to the right atrium. Lungs attach to the left
         atrium.
    - Ventricles :: [two ventricles] Left ventricle goes to the body. Right
         ventricle goes to the lungs.
    - Septum :: Muscular partition separating the right and left sides of the
         heart.
    - Atrioventricular (AV) valves :: Between the corresponding /atrium/ and
         /ventricle/ is an /atrioventricular valve/ which _prevents_ the _backwards
         flow_ of /blood/ in the /heart/.
    - Semilunar valves :: [two, pulmonary and aortic] Prevent backflow into the
         ventricles from the main arteries leaving the heart when the heart
         relaxes.

*** The pulmonary circuit provides for gas exchange and the systemic circuit serves the rest of the body
    - Pulmonary circuit :: The circuit where blood travels to and from the
         lungs.
    - Systemic circuit :: The circuit where blood travels to and from the
         body.
    - Coronary arteries :: _Supply_ the /heart muscle/ with /blood/. They branch from
         the /aorta/ just above the /aortic semi-lunar valve/ and _encircle_ the
         /heart's/ surface.
      - Latin /corona/ encircling like a crown
    - Cardiac veins :: _Collect_ the /blood/ _from_ the /capillaries/ _in_ the /heart
         muscle/ and channel it back _to_ the /right atrium/.

*** The cardiac cycle: The heart contracts and relaxes
    A complete /cardiac cycle/ involves _contraction_ of the two /atria/, which forces
    /blood/ _into_ the /ventricles/, followed by _contraction_ of the two /ventricles/,
    which pumps blood _into_ the /pulmonary artery/ and the /aorta/, followed by a
    _relaxation_ of the entire /heart/.

    [[file:Ch. 8/figure-40-03-03_2016-10-25_23-21-01.jpeg]]

    - Systole :: The period of contraction.
    - Diastole :: The period of relaxation.
    - Cardiac cycle :: The entire sequence of contraction and relaxation.
      1. /Atrial systole/. _Contraction_ starts, the heart is _already_ nearly filled
         with /blood/ that _entered_ the /ventricles/ and /atria/ passively during the
         previous /diastole/. During /atrial systole/, both /atria/ _contract_, raising
         blood pressure in the /atria/, then _filling_ the two /ventricles/ to
         capacity.
      2. /Ventricular systole/. _Contraction_ that began in the /atria/ spreads to the
         /ventricles/, then both /ventricles/ _contract_ simultaneously. /Pulmonary/ and
         /Aortic semilunar valves/ _open_ and /blood/ is _ejected_ into the /pulmonary
         trunk/ and the /aorta/.
      3. /Diastole/. Both /atria/ and both /ventricles/ are _relaxed_. Pressure within
         falls, the /pulmonary/ and /aortic semilunar valves/ _close_, _preventing
         backflow_, then the /AV valves/ _open_ and blood begins to _flow_ passively
         _into_ the /heart/.

*** Cardiac conduction system coordinates contraction
    The coordinated sequence of the cardiac cycle is due to the /cardiac
    conduction system/ a group of specialized /cardiac muscle cells/ that _initiate_
    and _distribute_ electrical /impulses/ throughout the /heart/.

    - Sinoatrial (SA) node :: A small mass of /cardiac muscle cells/ located _near_
         the _junction_ of the /right atrium/ and /superior cardiac muscle cells/
         elsewhere in the /heart/.
    - Atrioventricular (AV) node :: Mass of muscle cells between the /atria/ and
         /ventricles/ that _receives signals_.
    - Atrioventricular (AV) bundle :: From the /AV node/, the _electrical signal
         sweeps_ to this bundle or group of conducting fibers in the /septum/
         between the two /ventricles/.

*** Blood exerts pressure against vessel walls
    /Blood pressure/ is the force that blood exerts on the wall of a /blood vessel/.
    It is measured as two numbers corresponding to /systolic/ and /diastolic
    pressures/. /Hypertension/ (high blood pressure) is a serious risk factor for
    /cardiovascular disease/ and other health problems.

    | *Blood pressure category* | *systolic* (mm Hg) |     | *Diastolic* (mm Hg) |
    |-------------------------+------------------+-----+-------------------|
    |                         |                  | <c> |                   |
    | Normal                  | Less than 120    | and | Less than 80      |
    | Prehypertension         | 120--139         | or  | 80--89            |
    | Hypertension, Stage 1   | 140--159         | or  | 90--99            |
    | Hypertension, Stage 2   | 160 or higher    | or  | 100 or higher     |

    - Blood pressure :: _Force_ that /blood/ _exerts_ on the wall of a /blood vessel/ as
         a result of the pumping action of the /heart/.
    - Sphygmomanometer :: A tool for measuring /blood pressure/.
    - Systolic pressure :: The _highest pressure_ of the cycle reached _during_
         /ventricular systole/ when the /ventricles/ _contract_ to _eject_ /blood/ from
         the /heart/.
    - Diastolic pressure :: The _lower pressure_ occurring during /ventricular
         diastole/ when the /ventricles/ _relax_.
    - Hypertension :: /Blood pressure/ higher than normal. Significant risk factor
         for /cardiovascular disease/, because the _greater pressure_ means _more
         strain_ on /cardiovascular system/.

         It is called the "_silent killer_" because usually it has no symptoms.
    -  Hypotension :: When blood pressure is too low. Generally only a problem
         only if /blood pressure/ falls enough to reduce /blood/ flow to the /brain/,
         causing _dizziness_ and _fainting_.

*** Cardiovascular disorders: A major hearth issue
    /Cardiovascular disorders/ are the number one killer in the United States.
    Most disorders are caused either by conditions that result in failure of the
    /heart/ as a pump or by conditions in which _damage_ to /blood vessels/ _restricts
    flow_ or _ruptures vessels_.

    - Heart attack :: (/myocardial infarction/) Sudden death of an area of /heart
         tissue/ due to oxygen starvation.
    - Congestive heart failure :: High /capillary blood pressure/ causes more
         fluid that usual to filter out of the /capillaries/ and into the
         /interstitial space/, causing fluid congestion.

** Ch. 11
*** The Nervous System
    The nervous system has two major subdivisions: the /central nervous system/
    (CNS), consisting of the /brain/ and /spinal cord/, and the /peripheral nervous
    system/ (PNS), which includes all parts of the nervous system that lie
    outside the CNS. The motor division of the PNS has a /somatic division/, which
    controls /skeletal muscles/, and an /autonomic division/, which controls /smooth
    muscles/, /cardiac muscles/, and /glands/.

    The nervous system is the body's main _control_ system. Controls physical
    _movements_, maintains _homeostasis_ of many internal variables, and even
    initiates our _higher thought_ processes and _emotions_.

              - Sympathetic ::   [flight or flight] Excitatory pathway that
                   helps your body in times of _stress_ by _elevating_ blood
                   pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and the volume of
                   blood flow to muscles.
              - Parasympathetic :: [rest and digest] System most active in tames
                   of relaxation, and it stimulates gland secretions and
                   digestive processes while dampening sympathetic effects.

    - Neuroglia :: Specialized connective tissue cells of the nervous system.
         They do not generate or transmit impulses. Some secrete a special
         substance called /myelin/. Neuroglial cells _support_ and _protect_ /neurons/.
         Neuroglial cells called /Schwann cells/ (in the PNS) and /oligodendrocytes/
         (in the CNS) form /myelin sheaths/ that _protect_ /axons/ and _speed
         transmission_ of impulses.

         In the PNS, many /neuron axons/ are enclosed and protected by /neuroglial
         cells/ called /Schwann cells/. In the CNS, they are oligodendrocytes.

         Greek // neuron, glue
         - Schwann cells :: Neuroglia that secrete /myelin/ in the /peripheral
              nervous system/. Schwann cells wrap themselves around a short
              segment of an axon many times as a sort of insulating blanket,
              creating a _shiny white protective layer_ around the axon called a
              /myelin sheath/.

              Principal /glia/ of the peripheral nervous system
         - Oligodendrcytes :: Neuroglia that secrete myelin in the /central
              nervous system/. Unlike the sheath formed by Schwann cells, the
              sheath formed by oligodendrocytes degenerates once the axon it
              protects is destroyed, so the neurons of the central nervous
              system do not regenerate after injury--this is why spinal cord
              injuries and CNS disorders result in a permanent change or loss of
              function.
              - Do Oligodendrocytes send nerve signals? *NO*, no /neuroglia/ send
                signals.
         - Astrocytes :: neuroglial cells that form barriers around the neurons,
              shielding them from direct contact with substances carried in the
              blood. Form the basis of the blood-brain barrier.

    - Myelin sheath :: Surrounds the /axon/ of some nerve cells forming an
         electrically insulating layer around the neuron. White in color.

         Three important functions: *1)* It saves the /neuron/ energy, *2)* speeds up
         the transmission of impulses by preventing nearly all leakage of
         charged ions across the axon membrane causing action potentials to jump
         between nodes of Ranvier causing the /saltatory conduction/, and *3)* it
         helps damaged or severed axons of the peripheral nervous system
         regenerate.

    - Nerve :: 
              
    - Neurons :: Cell present in the nervous system highly specialized for
         communication.

         Carry electrical impulses in nervous tissue. Myelinated neurons can
         transmit electrical impulses more quickly than unmyelinated neurons.

         Also /interneurons/ within the CNS transmit impulses between components
         of the CNS. /Interneurons/ input from sensory neurons, integrate this
         information, and influence the function of other neurons.

         - Axon :: long, slender projection of a nerve cell, or /neuron/, that
              typically conducts electrical impulses away from the neuron's cell
              body. Contains a small amount of /cytoplasm/. Each axon terminal ends
              in a small, rounded tip called an /axon bulb/.
         - Dendrite :: Branched projections of a /neuron/ that act to propagate the
              electrochemical stimulation received from other neural cells to the
              cell body, or /soma/.
              - Greek /déndron/ tree
         - Soma :: Bulbous end of a /neuron/ containing the /cell nucleus/. The
              survival of some sensory neurons depends on /axon terminals/ making
              contact with sources of survival factors that prevent apoptosis.
              - Greek /somas/ body
         - Apoptosis :: process of programmed cell death that occurs in
              multicellular organisms. Between 50 and 70 billion cells die each day
              due to apoptosis in the average human adult.
              - Ancient Greek /apoptosis/ a falling off
         - Node of Ranvier :: [myelin sheath gaps] Periodic gaps in the insulating
              /myelin sheath/ of myelinated axons where the axonal membrane is
              exposed to the extracellular space.

*** Neurons initiate action potentials
    There are _millions_ of these /Sodium/ and /Potassium/ gates. Neurons generate
    and transmit electrical impulses from one part of the body to another.
    Sensory neurons transmit impulses to the CNS. Interneurons transmit impulses
    between components of the CNS. Motor neurons transmit impulses away from the
    CNS to muscles and glands.

    Action potential is greater in larger-diameter axons and in axons covered by
    an /insulating sheath/. A neuron's /resting potential/ of about -70 millivolts
    is _maintained_ by the _constant action_ of the sodium-potassium pump. Impulses
    arriving from other neurons can cause small, local changes in the neuron's
    membrane potential called /graded potentials/. The sum of all graded
    potentials may initiate a self-propagating, all-or-none action potential in
    a neuron. An action potential involves /three events/: _depolarization_,
    _repolarization_, and _reestablishment_.

    - Depolarization :: /Sodium/ moves into the axon. When threshold is exceed,
         voltage-sensitive Na^{=+=} channels in the axon's membrane open briefly
         and Na^{=+=} ions diffuse rapidly /into/ the cytoplasm of the axon.
    - Repolarization :: /Potassium/ moves out of the axon. After a short delay,
         Na^{=+=} channels close automatically. But the reversal of the membrane
         polarity triggers the opening of K^{=+=} channels that allows K^{=+=}
         ions to diffuse rapidly /out/ of the cell.
    - Reestablishment :: K^{=+=} channels are slow to close, so there is a brief
         overshoot of membrane voltage during which the interior of the /axon/ is
         slightly hyperpolarized. Shortly after the K^{=+=} channels close, the
         resting potential is reestablished.

*** Information is transferred from a neuron to its target
    At the axon terminal of a neuron, the action potential and its information
    must be converted to another form for transmittal to its target (muscles
    cell, gland cell, or another neuron). It reaches a junction called a
    /synapse/, where a chemical is released called a /neurotransmitter/ because it
    transmits a signal from a neuron to its target.

    - synapse :: A junction where information is converted from one form to
         another. 
         - presynaptic membrane :: The cell membrane of the neuron that is sending
              the information.
         - postsynaptic membrane :: The membrane of the cell that is about to
              receive the information.
         - synaptic cleft :: Fluid-filled gap that separates the pre- and post-
              synaptic membranes.

    - neurotransmitter ::

*** regions of the brain
    - Parietal lobe :: Interprets sensory information from skin.
    - Occipital lobe :: Processes visual information.
    - Frontal lobe :: Initiates motor activity. Responsible for speech.
         Conscious thought.
    - Temporal lobe :: Interprets auditory information. Comprehends language.
         Perceptual judgment.
         - Prefrontal cortex (PFC) :: The /cerebral cortex/ which covers the front
              part of the /frontal lobe/. Implicated in planning complex cognitive
              behavior, personality expression, decision making, and moderating
              social behavior.

*** parts of the brain
    - Pituitary gland :: Referred to as the 'master gland', but is about the
         size of a pea. Protrusion off the bottom of the /hypothalamus/ It
         controls several of the other /hormone glands/ (e.g. /adrenals/, /thyroid/).
         It sits in a bony hollow called the /pituitary fossa/ (it was called
         /sella turcica/ elsewhere as well).
    - amygdala :: A part of the /limbic system/ in the /temporal lobe/. When the
         amygdala senses threat, it becomes over-activated, blocking new
         sensory information from accessing the memory and association
         circuits.

         THIS MEANS THAT IF A STUDENT IS STRESSED OUT, THEY ACTUALLY CAN NOT
         LEARN. THE AMYGDALA IS BLOCKING information from going to higher
         cognitive centers of the brain, like the /prefrontal cortex/ where
         information is processed, associated, and stored for later retrieval
         and executive functioning

**** *Forebrain*
     Determines most _complex behavior_, including _emotions_ and conscious though.
     Important to the forebrain is /hypothalamus/ and /thalamus/, /limbic system/, and
     /cerebrum/.

     The hypothalamus and thalamus _maintain homeostasis_ and _process information_.
     The hypothalamus is a small region at the base of the forebrain that
     coordinates some automatic functions of the /pituitary gland/.

     - Cerebrum :: Coordinates _language_. Controls _decision making_. Produces
          _conscious thought_.
     - Corpus callosum :: Bridges the two cerebral hemispheres.
     - Thalamus :: Receives, processes, and transfers information.
     - Hypothalamus :: Part of the /limbic system/. Works mostly with the
          /autonomic nervous system/.

     auditory sensory inputs pass through the midbrain before being relayed to
     higher brain centers.

     - Midbrain :: Relays visual and auditory inputs. Coordinates movement.

**** *Hindbrain*
     The evolutionarily oldest, more primitive hindbrain controls must automatic
     activities.

         neurons.
         - Latin /saltare/ dance
    - Neuroplasticity :: Plasticity is the capacity of the brain to change with
         learning. There are three circumstances where neuroplasticity occurs in
         the brain:
         1. At the beginning of life: when the immature brain organizes itself.
         2. In case of brain injury: to compensate for lost functions or maximize
            remaining functions.
         3. Through adulthood: whenever something new is _learned_ and _memorized_.

*** Common neurotransmitters
    /NTS/ stands for Neurotransmitter Senses. Chemical messengers, are
    endogenous chemicals that enable neurotransmission. 
    
    Neurotransmitters do not use a transport system.

    - Neurohormone :: Just a hormone.

    - Acetylcholine :: Excitatory on skeletal muscles; excitatory or inhibitory
         at other sites, depending on receptors. Neurotransmitter used at the
         /neuromuscular junction/---it is the _chemical_ that /motor neurons/ of the
         nervous system release in order to _activate muscles_.
         - /Neuromuscular junctions/, /autonomic nervous systems/, /brain/
         - binds muscle cell(s)---causes depolarization.
    - Norepinephrine :: [noradrenaline] Excitatory or inhibitory, depending on
         receptors, plays a role in emotions. Synthesized and released by
         /central nervous system/ and also by the /sympathetic nervous system/.
         Norepinephrine is _produced_ in _closely packed_ /brain/ /cell neurons/. Exert
         powerful effect on the brain. Sympathetic ganglia, located in the
         /spinal cord/ or in the /abdomen/, uses norepinephrine; norepinephrine also

         the cell in question.

    - Cilia and flagella :: Projections from the cell. Move the cell itself or
         move substances over or around the cell.

*** Blood typing

    [[file:labs/tut3_compatible_blood_2016-09-20_13-13-59.jpg]]

    - agglutination :: mixtures have clumping
         
      - Blood agglutinating means the bloods mixed are not compatible with the
        kind of antibody.
      
      - No agglutination in tube with A antibodies means patient's RBC do not
        have A antigens.

      - Agglutination in tube with B antibodies means patient's RBC have B
        antigens.

      - No agglutination in the Rh tube means the patient's RBC do not have Rh
        antigens, so the blood is Rh-.
        
    - ABO blood system ::

      - O :: receives O

      - A :: receives A and O

      - B :: receives B and O

      - AB :: receives AB, A, B, and O
           
    - Rh blood system ::

      - Rh+ :: receives Rh+

      - Rh- :: receives Rh-

    - O Rh- :: /universal donor/

**** Issues and controversies

     The slide makes a point that each of these has a corresponding level of
     problem which needs to be dealt with as well. For example, on a community we
     need to consider problems about animal life that we impact, or on a cellular
     level we need to deal with cloning adult animals, plants, and humans from a
     single cell.

   - Birth Control (huge)
   
*** Buck vs. Bell (1927)
    
    We must sterilize the feeble minded. Sterilization of Carrie Buck because
    here genes were thought to be inadequate. "Three generations of imbeciles
    are enough."

*** Hitler

    Maybe the same thought process as Buck vs. Bell, honestly. He wanted to get
    rid of Jews, Homos, and Blacks?
